## 🧭 Why This Matters
2025 has officially become the "Year of the Megadeal." Following a wave of $40B+ transactions earlier this year, December is closing with a flurry of activity in tech and infrastructure. With the Fed delivering a final 25bps "insurance cut" this month, the cost of capital has stabilized, triggering a rush of strategic acquisitions before the 2026 fiscal year begins.

- **Structure:** All-cash
- **Sector:** Enterprise Software / Data Infrastructure

## 🔍 Deep Dive Insight
### **The Return of the Megadeal**
**What’s Happening**
The "Deal Logjam" of 2023-24 has officially broken. In 2025, we saw the reemergence of $40B+ transactions, including four such deals in the U.S. alone—a sharp contrast to zero in 2024.

**Why It Matters**
- **Regulatory Shift:** A more flexible approach from the Trump administration's DOJ/FTC has emboldened CEOs to pursue transformative "combinations of equals."
- **Private Equity Rebound:** Global PE deal volume hit ~$2tn this year as sponsors finally found exits via secondary buyouts and a resurgent IPO market.
- **Sovereign Wealth:** Middle Eastern funds (PIF, Mubadala) have pivoted from passive investors to lead strategic partners in AI and semiconductor deals.
